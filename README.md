# AUTOMATED-VEHICLE-DETECTION
This program utilizes OpenCV to detect and count vehicles in a video. It applies background subtraction, contour detection, and morphology operations to identify vehicles. The vehicles are tracked as they pass a defined line in the video, and the count is displayed on the video frame in real-time.
